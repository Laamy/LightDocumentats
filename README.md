# What is this?

This is a lua engine designed for minecraft 1.19.31 (Latest at this moment in time)
but should work on all versions beneath all the way until 1.17

it gives you quick access to creating high quality clients/cheats without needing to worry about updating it yourself or going through complex C/C++ training as we provide everything for you updated and ready to use

# How is this possible?

Well we rely on very special signatures which have not changed since 1.17 when i was developing trero/netherite
aswell as special offset sigs

Feel free to suggest anything you want and we'll try our best to give you high level access
