Documentation for the LIGHT API

# How to download & install?

The first copy of the light api will be publicly available in 7 days from now 

For those who somehow got a copy first you've got to inject light.dll then you put your scripts inside of C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.light\CorePackages (Name the main one Index.lua)

restart minecraft then reinject and your index.lua script will load
